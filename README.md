## About The Project

I'm a big believer in self-care and knowing when to switch off. But as a developer, the lines can get blurred - especially when working from home. 

I wanted to design a straight-forward yet important tool to take a second, focus on my breathing and tuning back in to the world around me. Breathing in time with the dial on display helps to refocus and take a break from the daily noise.
